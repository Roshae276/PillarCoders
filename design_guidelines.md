# Village Grievance Redressal System - Design Guidelines

## Design Approach: Government Portal with Rural Accessibility

**Selected Framework:** Hybrid approach combining Indian Government Digital Identity aesthetics (inspired by mygov.in, umang.gov.in) with accessibility-first principles for rural users with varying literacy levels.

**Core Principles:**
- Trust through formality and government authority
- Accessibility for low-literacy and first-time digital users
- Clear information hierarchy with visual status indicators
- Multi-modal interaction support (voice, touch, keyboard)

## Typography System

**Font Families:**
- Primary: Inter or Noto Sans (excellent multilingual support, high readability)
- Secondary: Poppins for headings (approachable yet authoritative)

**Type Scale:**
- Headings H1: 2.5rem (40px) - Page titles
- Headings H2: 2rem (32px) - Section headers
- Headings H3: 1.5rem (24px) - Card titles
- Body Large: 1.125rem (18px) - Important instructions, form labels
- Body: 1rem (16px) - Standard text
- Small: 0.875rem (14px) - Helper text, timestamps

**Weight Distribution:**
- Headings: 600-700 (Semi-bold to Bold)
- Body: 400-500 (Regular to Medium)
- Emphasis: 600 (Semi-bold)

**Critical Accessibility:**
- Minimum body text: 16px (18px preferred for primary content)
- Line height: 1.6 for body text, 1.3 for headings
- Letter spacing: 0.02em for improved readability

- Micro spacing: 1, 2 (4px, 8px) - Icon gaps, tight elements
- Component spacing: 4, 6, 8 (16px, 24px, 32px) - Internal padding, between form fields
- Section spacing: 12, 16, 20 (48px, 64px, 80px) - Between major sections
- Page spacing: 24, 32 (96px, 128px) - Top/bottom page margins

**Grid Systems:**
- Dashboard cards: 1 column mobile, 2 columns tablet, 3 columns desktop (grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3)
